# üìä Indian Demographics & Urban Insights using MySQL

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes **Indian Census city-level** data to uncover insights on **population, gender balance, literacy, and child demographics** across states and cities. 

Using **MySQL-based data exploration and analysis**, the project focuses on identifying **population trends, urban growth patterns, gender disparities, literacy performance, and graduate distribution**.

---
## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Understand Population Distribution** ‚Äì Identify the most populated cities, states, and urban centers, along with regions having significant child populations.

2. **Analyze Gender & Sex Ratio Trends** ‚Äì Explore overall sex ratio and child sex ratio patterns to highlight gender balance and imbalances across cities and states.

3. **Evaluate Literacy & Education Levels** ‚Äì Compare literacy rates (male, female, and overall), assess graduate distribution across states & cities.

4. **Study Child Demographics** ‚Äì Investigate child population distribution, child sex ratio, and states/cities with significant urban child populations.

5. **Measure Gender Disparities in Education & Population** ‚Äì Examine where female population exceeds male, and analyze female-to-male graduate ratios across regions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Steps

```SQL
-- Standardize city and state names
UPDATE cities SET name_of_city = UPPER(TRIM(name_of_city));
UPDATE cities SET state_name = UPPER(state_name);

-- Replace NULL values with 0
UPDATE cities
SET Population_total = COALESCE(Population_total, 0),
    Population_male = COALESCE(Population_male, 0),
    Population_female = COALESCE(Population_female, 0),
    below_age_6_population_total = COALESCE(below_age_6_population_total, 0),
    below_age_6_population_male = COALESCE(below_age_6_population_male, 0),
    below_age_6_population_female = COALESCE(below_age_6_population_female, 0),
    literates_total = COALESCE(literates_total, 0),
    literates_male = COALESCE(literates_male, 0),
    literates_female = COALESCE(literates_female, 0),
    sex_ratio = COALESCE(sex_ratio, 0),
    child_sex_ratio = COALESCE(child_sex_ratio, 0),
    effective_literacy_rate_total = COALESCE(effective_literacy_rate_total, 0),
    effective_literacy_rate_male = COALESCE(effective_literacy_rate_male, 0),
    effective_literacy_rate_female = COALESCE(effective_literacy_rate_female, 0),
    total_graduates = COALESCE(total_graduates, 0),
    male_graduates = COALESCE(male_graduates, 0),
    female_graduates = COALESCE(female_graduates, 0);

-- Remove invalid records
DELETE FROM cities
WHERE population_total <= 0 OR population_male < 0 OR population_female < 0;

-- Fix graduate inconsistencies
UPDATE cities
SET total_graduates = population_total*0.8
WHERE total_graduates > population_total;

-- Drop unused columns
ALTER TABLE cities DROP COLUMN dist_code, DROP COLUMN location;

## üìà Key Insights

- **Delhi & Mumbai** are among the most populated cities; **Maharashtra** & **Uttar Pradesh** lead by state population.
- **Maharashtra** has the highest population of children below the age of 6.
- Some states like **Kerala** exhibit **higher female-to-male ratios**, while others show child sex ratio imbalances.
- A few cities demonstrate a **balanced male-female population (~50-50)** like **Mysore**, **Darjiling**, **Coimbatore**, **Gangawati**.
- **Aizawl** has the highest male & female literacy rate among all the cities. **Kochi** is Second in both cases. 
- **Mizoram leads in female literacy** followed by **Kerala**, while some northern states like **Rajasthan**, **Jammu & Kashmir** ,**Uttar Pradesh**, **Bihar** lag significantly.
- Graduate analysis shows **metro cities dominate in absolute numbers**.
- **Kerala** has a much higher female graduates compared to male graduates, while **Bihar & Jharkhand** fall far behind compared to other states.
